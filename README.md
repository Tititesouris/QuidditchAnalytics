# Quidditch Analytics
This program uses the snitch catch time data available at https://quidditch.live/live.html to graph the probability of snitch catches over game time.  
Simply download each tournament page, place the html files in the `tournaments` folder and execute `main.py`.  
This will generate an image file `plot.png` containing the graphs.
